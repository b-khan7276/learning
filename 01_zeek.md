# Zeek aka bro

##  Intro to zeek 
  - Zeek is a passive network monitoring system
  - zeek can be installed on a "sensor", which can be hardware, software, virtual, or cloud platform that passively sniffs the network traffic
  - zeek generates compact, high-fidelity log files bases on what it sees in the network traffic
  - log files are fully customizable, suitble for manual review on disk or in a more analyst-firendly tool like a security and info event management (SIEM).
